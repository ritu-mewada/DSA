# Queue
Queue follows First In First Out principle.

Queue has two pointers:
1. Front: Points to first element of the queue
2. Rear: Points to last element of the queue

There are four types of queues:
1. Double Ended Queue
2. Circular Queue

Queues can be implemented using two data structures:
1. Array
2. Linked List

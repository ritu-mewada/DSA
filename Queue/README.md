# Queue
Queue follows First In First Out principle.

Queue has two pointers:
1. Front: Points to first element of the queue
2. Rear: Points to last element of the queue

Queues can be implemented using two data structures:
1. Array
2. Linked List

To reduce the memory wastage during implementation of queue using array, circular queue is used.
